<!-- Easiest way to use JavaScript is to write it within .html file in <body> -->
<!-- Can also do external script with <script src="javascript.js"></script> -->

<!-- Variables -->
<!-- Storage containers for data in code -->

<!-- To make variable, use: let -->
<!-- let user = 'John', age = 25, message = 'Hello' -->
<!-- For readability, use one line one variable -->

<!-- For older scripts, var is used -->
<!-- ALmost the same, except: -->

<!-- Has no block scope (either function or global scoped) -->
<!-- So if defined in an if or for statement, will be defined to the code outside -->

<!-- Tolerates redeclarations, can do var x = 5;, var x = 2; -->
<!-- Redeclarations are ignored -->

<!-- Can be declared after its use, as the code first defines vars then runs -->

<!-- Variable naming, can not start with digit, only can have letters/digit/$/_ -->
<!-- camelCase is every word capitalized except start, no _ -->

<!-- Technically if don't put "use strict" at beginning of code, don't need to declare vars -->

<!-- Constants = unchangin variable -->
<!-- Usually values that are set at start of code as const are named in all caps -->

<!-- VARIABLE NAMING VERY IMPORTANT TO SHOW EXPERIENCE! -->
