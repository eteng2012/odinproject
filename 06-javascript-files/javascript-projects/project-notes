Library:
- Reviewed a lot of the JS syntax and functions
  - querySelector(), addEventListener("click", () => ...)
- Learned about arrow functions () =>, easy way to make implicit functions without defining on outside
- Used dialog modals
  - .showModal() and .close() to show/hide
  - They pop up in middle of screen
  - Use event.preventDefault(); to stop sending data to server from button submit
    - This prevents default action of event
  - To access input values, use document.getElementById('author').value, id="author" for that input element
  - document.querySelector('input[name="read"]:checked').value is psuedoclass for radio button to get value

- Can not add an event listener to things that have not yet been declared, if do it at beginning nothing happens
  - Add when first created

- Can not use this.parentElement because arrow function used
  - Arrow uses surrounding context (function?) rather than element triggering event as "this"

- .forEach() loop, use (book, index), () => ... to get index of element
