    <!-- Above opens link on same tab, below can change where link opened -->
    <!-- target attribute is location, _blank is blank tab, rel is relationship between current and linked -->
    <!-- noopener means opened link has no access to webpage that opened it -->
    <!-- noreferrer stops opened link from knowing what page opened it, no reference, includes noopener behavior -->
    <!-- This is done for security reasons, noopener stops phising attacks, changing original webpage to different one -->
    <!-- Okay to not add as browsers also have this security -->
