/* Frameworks and Preprocessors (precompilers) commonly found in workplace */
/* Interviews for entry-level focus more on CSS fundamentals, even if job uses framework/preprocessor */
/* USE VANILLA CSS IN PROJECTS! NEED TO DEVELOP STRONG FUNDAMENTALS! */



/* Frameworks */

/* Bootstrap packages commonly used CSS code, like icons and interactions */
    /* Abstracts coding process */
/* Tailwind changes how CSS applied through different syntax */
    /* Supplies pre-named classes */
/* These are all just bundles of CSS */
    /* Many provide class called .btn that adds all needed styles to buttons, without needing to write CSS */
/* Many frameworks exist (Bulma, Foundation) */
/* Basically collection of preprepared CSS stylesheets */

/* Issue include similar sites due to using same framework */
/* Also, learning frameworks too early leads to lack of basic CSS knowledge */
    /* Overriding framework styling and debugging hard without fundamentals */
/* HARD TO REMOVE FRAMEWORK ONCE START PROJECT WITH IT! */



/* Preprocessors (precompilers) */

/* Languages that help CSS writing */
    /* Reduce code repetition */
    /* Saves time/code */
    /* Includes loops and conditionals, joining multiple stylesheets */
/* They are extensions of vanilla CSS */
/* Most of their features implemented into vanilla CSS, so maybe not worth learning */
/* Include SASS, LESS, Stylus */
