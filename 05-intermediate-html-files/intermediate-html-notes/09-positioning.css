/* Static and Relative Positioning */

/* Default position in mode is static */
/* Relative is same but properties top, right, bottom, left displace element relative to position in document */
    /* Example: position: relative; top: 10px */
/* Basically displaces element from normal static position */


/* Absolute Positioning */

/* postition: absolute positions element at exact point on screen without disturbing other elements around it */
/* Removes element from normal document flow, relative to an ancestor element */
/* Don't affect other elements, not affected by others */
/* Can use top, right, bottom, left to position */
    /* However, will be relative to first parent element that is not static or just the root */
    /* top: 0 will go to top of screen unless parent is not static */

/* Use cases include modals, image with caption, icon on elements */
/* However, prioritize using flexbox/grid */




/* Fixed Positioning */

/* Also removed from flow, position relative to viewport, same top, right, ... */
/* Stays in place as user scrolls */
/* Good for navigation bar, chat button */



/* Sticky Positioning */

/* Normal until scroll past element, then start behaving like fixed elements */
/* Good for section headings */
